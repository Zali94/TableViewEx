# TableViewEx

- Implemented tableView and filled table from items within an array 
- Used didSelectAtRow of tableView DataSource protocol to send data to a different view
- Implemented my own protocol which allowed user to update the text item selected and have that persist on the table
- Used navigation to push and pop views 
- Worked with extensions
